# Stellar Dex

This Dex swaps two tokens between two authorized parties atomically.

## Installation / Setup

- [Soroban Setup](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup)

## Getting Started

**Initialize the project**:
   ```bash

   ```

**Add a new Soroban contract**:
   You can add new contracts by creating new subdirectories under `contracts/` and adding the necessary files (`Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`, etc.).

   Each contract comes with its own test suite. Navigate to the contract's directory and run:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
